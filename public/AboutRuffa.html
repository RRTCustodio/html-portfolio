<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Ruffa H. Custodio, born on August 27, 1988, in Davao City, Philippines.</p>
<p>I'm a proud Filipino and a dedicated registered nurse, licensed in the Philippines, Saudi
Arabia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand ðŸ©º. While nursing has been a meaningful
part of my journey, I've currently paused my professional career to focus on what matters
mostâ€”being a full-time mom to my two wonderful children, Gavin and Jacob ðŸ’–.
</p>
<p>These days, I enjoy watching Korean dramas ðŸ“º and spending quality time with my kids,
making sure Iâ€™m present for their growth, learning, and school life. Family is my heart, and
nurturing them is my greatest joy.

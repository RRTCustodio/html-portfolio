<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Tristan Jacob H. Custodio, born on October 20, 2024, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I'm a proud Filipino who loves swimming, diving into computer games, and discovering
new places through travel. My biggest dream is to become an international pilot ✈️—so
I can soar across the skies and explore the world one flight at a time. The sky isn’t the limit
—it’s just the beginning!
